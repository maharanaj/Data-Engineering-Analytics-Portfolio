# Data-Engineering-Analytics-Portfolio
This repository showcases end-to-end data engineering and analytics solutions built with modern cloud tooling.   It is designed as a **mini-portfolio** to demonstrate my exposure to pipeline design, data quality, governance, and dashboarding skills.

---
## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Scenario 1 (Finance / Superannuation):**
  - Migration-style ELT pipeline (Snowflake â†’ BigQuery) with dbt models.
  - Compliance artefacts aligned with APRA CPS 234.
  - Power BI dashboard: "Member Contributions & Balances."

- **Scenario 2 (Retail / FMCG):**
  - Near real-time pipeline (Pub/Sub â†’ Dataflow â†’ BigQuery).
  - dbt models for sales & promotions.
  - Power BI dashboard: "Sales by Product & Store."

---
## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Cloud / Data:** BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Data Factory, Databricks
- **Transformation:** dbt (staging, intermediate, mart layers)
- **Orchestration:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Cloud Composer (optional)
- **Dashboards:** Power BI, Looker Studio
- **Programming:** Python, SQL (Snowflake SQL + BigQuery SQL)

## âœ… How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repo.
2. Load `data/sample_data.csv` into BigQuery (sandbox account is free).
3. Run dbt project (`dbt run`) for staging â†’ marts.
4. Review dashboards in `/dashboards/screenshots`.
5. Explore compliance artefacts in `/compliance`.

## ðŸ“Š Portfolio Deliverables
- End-to-end ELT pipeline
- Automated dbt tests in CI/CD
- Finance + Retail dashboards
- Compliance artefacts (mock APRA)
- Case study PDF (problem â†’ solution â†’ outcome)
